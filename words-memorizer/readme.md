## A quizlet-like web app
* Implemented to work like quizlet when it comes to learning new words but with a few extra features.
* In the languages that contain the Masculine and Feminine in their nouns like German and Spanish, it must use AI to generate an image for the word that expresses the noun Gender as well as the noun itself.
* It can put the noun in a description that fits its gender. (i.e. In German, the bridge "Die Br√ºcke", is a feminine so it is put in the description of beauty and wonderful. On the other hand in Spanish, the bridge "El puente", is a masculine so it is put in the description of strong and steady)
* It can use AI to generate image for any word actually that expresses that word in the best way in the eyes of the people speaking with that particular language.
* It must be enjoyable, addictive, and very helpful.
